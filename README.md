Estate Portal extends the Portal and Estate modules to provide a user-friendly interface for browsing listed properties. It allows logged-in users to view available real estate, place bids, and track the status of their offers. Access control ensures that only authenticated users can submit bids. The portal includes filters for easier property browsing and displays up-to-date information on each property's current state and bidding activity.
